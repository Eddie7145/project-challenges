## My Process

Just like how I start any process I start by mental visualizing the product, which was easier because designs were made available to me.
Then I start to visually see how the product works and how it would be implemented. I start in a rough layout choose what technologies I would use to accomplish such task.
Then I dive into my HTML, and start laying out the structure of the webpage. But before this taking a closer look at the project I would outline what names I would give to each element and then identify who is the parent and child element in this project, but I then start my execution.
On execution it is typical for me or any developer to find or bump into one or two problems, but how i tackle my problems is by testing different use cases for the said problem, but if I see that it's too much of a headache, I take some time off to clear my head by having a conversation with someone (gisting), watching a movie, listen to some music, take a nap, take a stroll around the neighbourhood.
In the process I found that it helps alot, because when I take this time off to clear my head and just relax, my mind to just clears up and allows me to think more indepthly and clearly, and often times I just figure out that maybe it because i didn't add a terminator to block, or just spelt it wrong or I was going about tackling the situation the wrong way and then I go back to my desk clear headed and ready to execute.
Often times when I don't just have any idea on how to tackle a given idea, I just go on Google and search, read some articles, watch some videos on how to tackle said problem or just ask for help from my fellow developers and friends. 


## Built_with

For this specific project I wanted to test new waters and the project prompted me to learn new things and help me to write my first line of Javasript on my own.

So for this project I go to use:
- [HTML]
-[CSS_GRID_AREAS](For_the_layout) 
-[Vanilla_JavaScript]


## What_I_Learned

I want to create more projects so as to learn more and master some technologies.
This project helped me to tackle my problems of using CSS Grids, and it forced me to learn about it and I eventually feel in love with the `Grid Areas` and it's more my type since I'm more of a graphical person.
I also go to learn other types of Grid layouts, but I would like to stick with the GRID AREAS for now.
This project also forced me to learn JavaScript, as it highly needed in this field of development, although I didn't write much code in Javascript for this project, but I really enjoyed learning it, though it wasn't easy, it open my mind to new possibilites and more ways creating good and efficient products and I definitely learn more.


## Continued_development

I recently started my learning journey in `JavaScript` which I'm very ethusiastic about, and would like to learn more about it's `Frameworks` and hopefully master a few.
I'll also want to learn how to use `CSS PREPROCESSOR` and `FRAMEWORKS`, hopefully in further projects I will integrate them in in my codes.
I also want to learn `Blockchain Development` because I'm very intrigued with this new wave of technology, and would to get my hands on it by learning `Solidity`.

## Acknowledgments

I want to use this opportunity to thank [Frontend_Mentor], for giving developers a s whole a platform to hone our skills and building us to becoming better developers and creating better projects. With their efforts we have a better mind, sense of purpose and what is needed as developers.

So if you've found yourself here you can join me on this journey by reading my blogs and following them as I try to create amazing contents which I myself and every developer can use to get more insight on what to do and how to do.

If you're just starting out and you've found yourself here it means your really interested and I would advice you to join [Frontend_Mentor] by clicking this link (https://www.frontendmentor.io) and start your journey today.

Don't waste your time going through crash course or warching videos instead put more nergy into doing (coding) and watch yourself flourish as a developer.
