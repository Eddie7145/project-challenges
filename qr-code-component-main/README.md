##  Overview
- [OVERVIEW]
    This is a Front-end Mentor Challenge used to develop and test developers on what and how to tackle different projects. 
    This is known as "The QR-CODE" project. I used this project to test my abilities as a developers, and also to expand my knowledge on web development. 
    This is my first project on The Front-end Mentor platform and I'm hoping to grow, learn and practice more.

## My Process
- [MY_PROCESS]
    Before delving into any project, I first try to look at it from a different stand point, pick out obvious points/parts of the project.

    Then I try to think of possible solutions to the said projects, by somehow imagining or writing the codes for different components or sections of the project, sometimes if it's a personal project I try to visually represent the overall structure of the project before actually starting it out. This where i write down the various styles (fonts, colors, images etc), that'll be used for the said project.

    I try to tackle a problem by segmenting it and soving it piece by piece until the overall problem is solved.

    Whenever I'm faced with a problem that's to hard, complex for me to tackle or understand, I go on YouTube, Google or any information based API and get my answers and think of how to interpret and use them into my own projects. 


## Technologies Used

    - CSS Custom Properties 
    - Google Fonts
    - Dev Tools.


## What I learned
- [WHAT_I_LEARNED]
    Being a creative and imaginative person has helped me a lot when building projects, tackling different problems and also creating new ideas. 
    This project majorly opened my eyes to seeing things from a different perspective as this helps to see the things differently and enables one tackle problems and provide solution differently.
    As a developer I've learned a lot characteristical lessons when it comes to the type of behaviours good software developers should have in order to grow and flourish.
    This helped to be more open-minded and not think of solutions to a certain problem more rigidly, instead I should more creative when tackling problems and builiding projects.
    I also learnt how to ask questions because no man is an island, so in order for me to develop and grow I have to always seek information and knowledge.


### Continued Developement
    - I'd like to focus more on CSS displays, Grids, Pre-processor and Frameworks
    - I'd like to also learn a few technologies including Python, React Js, Solidity, Vue Js etc
